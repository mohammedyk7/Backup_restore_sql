# üßæ TrainingDB Backup & Restore Full Error Log
**Prepared by:** Mohammed Yusuf Alkhusaibi

## üóÇ Scenario
This task tested SQL Server‚Äôs full, differential, and log backup/restore process using the `TrainingDB` database. The operation included full backups, inserting data, taking differential and log backups, and simulating disaster recovery.

---

## ‚ùå Issues Encountered

### 1. **Access Denied on Backup**
- **Error:** Cannot open backup device. Operating system error 5 (Access is denied).
- **Fix:** Folder permission was granted to `NT SERVICE\MSSQLSERVER`.

---

### 2. **Restore Failure ‚Äì Database in Use**
- **Error:** Exclusive access could not be obtained because the database is in use.
- **Fix:** Used `ALTER DATABASE TrainingDB SET SINGLE_USER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE`.

---

### 3. **Restore Chain Mismatch**
- **Error:** Differential backup cannot be restored because the database has not been restored to the correct earlier state.
- **Cause:** The differential `.bak` was not tied to the full `.bak` used for restore.
- **Diagnosis:** Used `RESTORE HEADERONLY` to compare `CheckpointLSN` of full and `DifferentialBaseLSN` of diff. They did not match.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Fix and Clean Test

### 1. Recreated TrainingDB
- Inserted two initial rows and took a **clean full backup**.
- Added a third row and took a **clean differential backup**.

### 2. Restored Backups
```sql
RESTORE DATABASE TrainingDB FROM DISK = 'CleanFull.bak' WITH NORECOVERY;
RESTORE DATABASE TrainingDB FROM DISK = 'CleanDiff.bak' WITH RECOVERY;
```

### 3. Final Verification
```sql
SELECT * FROM Students;
```

**Result:**
```
1 | Sara Ali        | 2023-09-01
2 | Mohammed Nasser | 2023-10-15
3 | Fatma Said      | 2024-01-10
```

---

## üìå Conclusion
The restore only showed `Fatma Said` after using the correct matching full and differential backup set. Errors during restore usually happen when:
- `WITH NORECOVERY` is skipped for full
- Differential is based on another full backup
- Copy-only backups break the restore chain

---

**Status:** ‚úÖ SUCCESS ‚Äî Clean backup/restore with full + diff chain.
